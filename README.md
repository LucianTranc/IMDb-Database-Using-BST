# IMDb-Database-Using-BST
C program that enables the user to find the list of actors in a movie, or a list of movies that an actor played in. This is done by creating three different binary search trees
that are indexed using different keys. The result is fast look up times after the program builds the database.

I have only included a small example file since the actual files I tested with are 2GB.

# What I learned
* This was a project from a Data Structures class I took at the University of Guelph
* Deeper understanding of binary search trees and linked lists
* Creating programs that can function on a large scale

# To run
* make
* ./a3 ./database
* Then follow the instructions on the command line

The available actor options from this example are:
* Chris Evans
* Chris Hemsworth
* Scarlett Johansson
* John Leguizamo
* Keanu Reeves
* Taika Waititi
* Jon Favreau

The available title options from this example are:
* Avengers: End Game
* Iron Man
* John Wick
* Jojo Rabbit
